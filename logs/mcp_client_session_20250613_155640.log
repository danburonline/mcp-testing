2025-06-13 15:56:57,647 - INFO - ENHANCED RESPONSE: It seems there was an issue with the search results, and they don't provide a straightforward answer to your question about today's weather. However, I can summarize the relevant information extracted from the results.

According to one of the snippets, the weather today is **clear and sunny**, with a temperature of **24Â°C**. This suggests a pleasant day, likely ideal for outdoor activities.

Unfortunately, the other search results were unrelated or nonsensical, so they do not contribute useful information about the weather.

If you need more specific weather details, such as forecasts or conditions for a particular location, please let me know!
