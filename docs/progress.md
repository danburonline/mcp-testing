# Progress Documentation

## Step 1: Initial Project Setup

- Created the basic project structure
- Established the foundation for an MCP testing environment

## Step 2: Python Environment Configuration

- Set up Python virtual environment using `uv` (modern Python package manager)
- Configured `pyproject.toml` with essential dependencies:
  - `fastmcp>=2.8.0` - FastMCP framework for building MCP servers
  - `ipykernel>=6.10.0` - Jupyter notebook support
  - `openai>=1.86.0` - OpenAI API client
  - `python-dotenv>=1.1.0` - Environment variable management
  - `python-env>=1.0.0` - Python environment utilities
- Added `.python-version` file for Python version management
- Created comprehensive `.gitignore` file

## Step 3: Documentation Updates

- Enhanced README.md with detailed setup instructions
- Added prerequisites for Bun and uv installation
- Included environment setup and dependency installation steps

## Step 4: Educational Content Creation

- Created `notebooks/` directory for educational content
- Added `001_openai-api_testing.ipynb` notebook demonstrating:
  - Python environment verification
  - OpenAI API integration
  - Basic chat completion example using GPT-4o-mini
  - Proper API key handling with environment variables

## Step 5: Python Version Compatibility

- Resolved compatibility issues with the latest Python version
- Ensured smooth operation across different Python environments

## Step 6: Documentation Refinement

- Further improved documentation clarity
- Added more detailed setup instructions

## Step 7: Project Simplification

- Streamlined project configuration
- Leveraged native `uv` features for better dependency management
- Simplified documentation to focus on essential steps

## Step 8: Error Resolution

- Fixed issues related to the FastMCP framework
- Ensured proper MCP server functionality

## Step 9: Enhanced Testing Instructions

- Added comprehensive instructions for using the MCP Inspector
- Included steps for visual inspection of the MCP server
- Added Bun installation and usage instructions for the inspector tool

## Step 10: Transport Protocol Update

- **Major Enhancement**: Switched from stdio to HTTP transport for the MCP server
- Updated `src/server/main.py` to use streamable HTTP transport
- Configured server to run on `localhost:9000`
- Updated README with instructions for MCP Inspector usage via HTTP endpoint
- This change enables:
  - Better debugging capabilities
  - Visual inspection through the MCP Inspector tool
  - More robust communication between client and server
