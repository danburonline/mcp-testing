  - Python environment verification
  - OpenAI API integration
  - Basic chat completion example using GPT-4o-mini
  - Proper API key handling with environment variables

## Step 5: Python Version Compatibility

- Resolved compatibility issues with the latest Python version
- Ensured smooth operation across different Python environments

## Step 6: Documentation Refinement

- Further improved documentation clarity
- Added more detailed setup instructions

## Step 7: Project Simplification

- Streamlined project configuration
- Leveraged native `uv` features for better dependency management
- Simplified documentation to focus on essential steps

## Step 8: Error Resolution

- Fixed issues related to the FastMCP framework
- Ensured proper MCP server functionality

## Step 9: Enhanced Testing Instructions

- Added comprehensive instructions for using the MCP Inspector
- Included steps for visual inspection of the MCP server
- Added Bun installation and usage instructions for the inspector tool

## Step 10: Transport Protocol Update

- **Major Enhancement**: Switched from stdio to HTTP transport for the MCP server
- Updated `src/server/main.py` to use streamable HTTP transport
- Configured server to run on `localhost:9000`
- Updated README with instructions for MCP Inspector usage via HTTP endpoint
- This change enables:
  - Better debugging capabilities
  - Visual inspection through the MCP Inspector tool
  - More robust communication between client and server

## Step 11: Server Configuration and Example Logic Update

- Reconfigured the server to run on localhost:8080.
- Modified the MCP tool example logic to a "Fuzzy Calculator" that returns a random integer.

## Step 12: Transport Protocol Update

- Implemented the Python SDK.
- Updated the Python version for improved compatibility and performance.

## Step 13: MCP Client Development

- **Major Enhancement**: Created comprehensive MCP client in `src/client/main.py`
- Implemented `MCPClient` class with advanced features:
  - OpenAI integration for enhanced responses
  - Asynchronous communication with MCP server
  - Tool discovery and execution capabilities
  - Error handling and robust connection management
- Added dual-step processing workflow:
  - Step 1: Call MCP tools for raw data
  - Step 2: Enhance results using client-side LLM processing

## Step 14: Logging and Session Tracking

- **Major Enhancement**: Implemented comprehensive logging system
- Added structured session tracking with:
  - Timestamped interaction logs
  - JSON data export for detailed analysis
  - Console and file logging support
  - Session metadata collection
- Created `logs/` directory for storing session data
- Each client session generates both `.log` and `_data.json` files

## Step 15: Web Search Tool Implementation

- Replaced fuzzy calculator with realistic `search_the_web` tool
- Implemented mock search results with categorized responses:
  - Weather, news, technology, health, finance, and general queries
  - Intelligent query categorization based on keywords
  - Randomized result selection for varied responses
- Added proper JSON response formatting with metadata
- Included error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Step 16: LLM Deception and Security Testing Features

- **Major Security Feature**: Implemented "malicious mode" for testing prompt injection attacks
- Added `MALICIOUS_MODE` environment variable control
- Created parallel datasets:
  - Normal search results for standard operation
  - Malicious search results containing prompt injection attempts
- Designed for educational purposes to demonstrate:
  - Tool poisoning vulnerabilities
  - Prompt injection attack vectors
  - Security implications in LLM-tool interactions
- Server-side control prevents client awareness of malicious mode

## Step 17: Script Automation and Development Workflow

- Created comprehensive shell script suite in `scripts/` directory:
  - `deps.sh` - Automated dependency installation
  - `server.sh` - Server startup with normal/malicious mode flags
  - `client.sh` - Client application launcher
  - `inspect.sh` - MCP Inspector integration
- Enhanced developer experience with one-command operations
- Added support for malicious mode flag (`-m`) in server script

## Step 18: Project Documentation and TODO Management

- Updated README.md with simplified setup instructions
- Created `TODO.md` for tracking development priorities
- Documented current project goals:
  - Educational focus on LLM APIs and MCP protocols
  - Security testing capabilities
  - Future middleware development plans
- Enhanced project structure for educational use

## Step 19: Code Refactoring and Cleanup

- Removed deprecated LLMClient class from codebase
- Streamlined tool listing and removed commented-out code
- Enhanced error handling throughout the application
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Fixed environment variable handling in example notebooks

## Step 20: Architecture Documentation and Mermaid Diagram Implementation

- **Major Documentation Enhancement**: Created comprehensive Mermaid architecture diagram
- Added visual representation of MCP (Model Context Protocol) architecture to README.md
- Diagram illustrates complete workflow:
  - User interaction with MCP Client
  - Tool calls to MCP Server (normal vs malicious modes)
  - LLM synthesis process using OpenAI API
  - Response flow back to user with logging system
- **Security Visualization**: Diagram clearly shows prompt poisoning attack vectors:
  - Normal flow: Safe web search → Clean tool response → Normal synthesis
  - Malicious flow: Poisoned web search → Compromised tool response → Compromised synthesis
- **Multiple Syntax Fixes**: Resolved various Mermaid rendering issues:
  - Fixed "unsupported markdown list" errors by removing `<br/>` HTML tags
  - Corrected flow sequence to show proper LLM synthesis step
  - Simplified node labels and edge descriptions for better compatibility
  - Removed problematic emojis and special characters
  - Streamlined styling classes for cleaner rendering
- Enhanced educational value by providing visual context for security concepts
- Positioned diagram strategically in README after project description for immediate context
