# TODOs

- [ ] Remove JSON logging bug (once tried to, but bug is still there)
- [ ] Move all tools outside of the MCP server file
- [ ] Build a simple middleware example (minimally working example)
- [ ] Build the middleware to detect if the answers from the MCP server/tool are deceptive/malicious
